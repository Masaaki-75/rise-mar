This is the official repository for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15610) "Radiologist-in-the-Loop Self-Training for Generalizable CT Metal Artifact Reduction", where we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning framework that leverages both simulated and real data for clinical CT metal artifact reduction. We are currently cleaning the code. Please stay tuned!
